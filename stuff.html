            My Hero Academia, or Boku no Hero Academia, is a very good manga/anime. It is one of 
            my favorite animes because of its storyline, characters, and art. It is currently on its
            fifth season. 
           </p>

            <p>
                This anime follows the life of Katarina Claes, a somewhat dense person. It's a pretty funny,
                lighthearted anime that would be enjoyable for all ages.

                This is a picture of mangos currently growing in my yard (July 2021). I like to eat fruits, but 
                sometimes they are expensive...as in $15/lb!!! Thus my family grows expensive fruits in the yard.

            <p>
                Buying milk tea adds up. Its like $5 a cup. Well, a hack I saw online is with Trader Joe's 
                Black Tea Concentrate. Take some milk, add the Black Tea Concentrate and some simple brown sugar 
                syrup ( brown sugar boiled in water). I recommend a 1 cup milk, 1/4 cup Black Tea Concentrate,
                and 1/3 brown sugar ratio. And letting the drink sit in the fridge for about 2 hours for the best
                flavor.

                If you have two hair swirls going opposite of each other, your hair sticks up! On my brother, it's 
                the cutest!!!! :D

                My sister made strawberry syrup and so I asked her to make me some fancy stawberry milk. Its topped
                with strawberry whipped cream, chocolate shavings, and mint leaves.

            <p>
                My mom wanted fruit tarts...My sister delivered. The creme is a lemon flavored pastry creme, with the 
                lemon flavor coming from Trader Joe's Lemon Curd. Hack for the crust: use Trader Joe's PREMADE pie
                crusts.

                This anime follows the life of an ordinary, Japanese, middle aged man that was killed and then
                reincarnated as a "monster." More particularly, a slime. The slime grows in power and along 
                the way build a peaceful and properous village of monsters.

                I recently had this tea from Pete's coffee. I believe that its a Berry Hibsiscus Tea...It was
                very tasty and flavorful.

                I like eating this yogurt with some vanila granola (Sprouts), bananas, and either honey or 
                maple syrup.
