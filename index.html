<h1>Welcome!!</h1>
<p>
 Welcome to my blog, which is aptly named. So my name is Michelle and as noted at the top of my blog...I am 
 not a confident person, most of the time. New things sorta scare me, leaving me with stomach aches and
 headaches. After what is new passes, I feel better because I know what to expect.
</p>

<p>
 Well, enough about that. The main purpose of this blog is for me to learn front-end programming using stuff 
 like HTML, CSS, and etc...The reason for the page called "In Progress" is to test out new ideas without 
 messing around with the entire blog.
